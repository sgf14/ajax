jqGet file set read me file.

Started work Nov 15 after getting jqLoad file set to work.  using SAJ ajax chapter, lpmj and Web App book.
PHP Cookbook pg 432 Integrating with JavaScript example is helpful in getting this to work.

Current working version:
indexAjaxTabGetJSON=  has corresponding JSON example but connection to DB not working as of Nov15

Testbed data:
indexAjaxTabGet group= has XML example (but no connection to DB) based on SAJ template
indexW3sch= has W3C schools basic ajax example
